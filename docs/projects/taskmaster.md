# TaskMaster

## Introduction

 A web-based task 
management application designed for small to mid-sized companies aiming to improve 
communication, streamline task assignments, and enhance productivity. Task Master 
provides users with a structured platform for task allocation, real-time updates, and priority 
management, addressing the common issues of informal and inefficient task handling. The 
application leverages the Vue.js framework for a responsive, user-friendly interface, while 
Firebase handles real-time data synchronization, user authentication, and notifications. 
## Features

 The application’s core functionalities include:

### 1. Task Assignment and Management 
- The admin can create new tasks and assign them to specific employees. 
- Admins can set task priorities (e.g., High, Medium, Low) and specify deadlines. 
- Employees can view the list of tasks assigned to them, along with their details and 
deadline. 

### 2. Real-Time Updates and Notifications
- Employees receive real-time notifications when new tasks are assigned or existing 
tasks are updated. 
- Admins receive notifications when an employee has started working on a task and 
when he/she has submitted. 

### 3. Task History and Tracking 
- Admins can view a history of assigned tasks for each employee. 
- Employees can view their own task history to track completed work. 

### 4. Workload Management
- Admins can view the overall task workload for each employee.  
- Admins can balance assignments by limiting the number or priority of tasks 
assigned to individual employees to prevent overload.
